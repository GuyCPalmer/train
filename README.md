## About
Train is a firebase backed scheduling application built using HTML, CSS and JQuery to render the schedule. 

Firebase is used to host a globally available set of data that is retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.
